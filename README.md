## Introduction

**BlockCert** is a blockchain-based certificate verification system that ensures the authenticity and integrity of certificates issued by educational institutions, employers, and other organizations. Built on the Ethereum blockchain and using decentralized storage via **IPFS**, this system provides a secure, transparent, and efficient solution for issuing, storing, and verifying certificates.

The project leverages **smart contracts** to automate the process, and **MetaMask** is used for secure login and digital signatures. It includes three main entities:
- **Student**: Receives certificates.
- **Institute**: Issues certificates to students.
- **Employer**: Verifies certificates issued by institutes.

## Features

- üöÄ **Blockchain-based Verification**: Ensures that certificates cannot be altered once issued.
- üîê **Secure Login with MetaMask**: Uses MetaMask for user authentication and signing transactions.
- üåê **Decentralized Storage with IPFS**: Certificates are stored securely on IPFS with content references stored on the blockchain.
- üìú **Smart Contracts**: Automates certificate issuance and verification processes.
- üîç **Transparency**: Provides full transparency and auditability of all issued certificates.

## Technology Stack

- **Ethereum**: Blockchain platform for immutability and security.
- **IPFS**: Decentralized file storage for certificate PDFs.
- **MetaMask**: Ethereum wallet for user authentication and signing transactions.
- **Truffle Suite**: For smart contract development and deployment.
- **Ganache CLI**: Local Ethereum blockchain for development.
- **Streamlit**: Python library for creating web applications and user interfaces.
- **Docker**: Containerizes the entire application for easy deployment.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js (v21.0.0 or higher)**: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Python (3.9.10 or higher)**: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Docker**: [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- **Ganache CLI**: Install Ganache for running a local Ethereum blockchain:
  ```bash
  npm install -g ganache-cli
  ```
-**Truffle**: Install Truffle for smart contract development:
``` bash
npm install -g truffle
```

Installation Steps
Clone the Repository:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Vignesh-2109/BlockCert-A-Decentralized-Certificate-Verification-System.git
```

Install Dependencies:

```bash

cd BlockCert-A-Decentralized-Certificate-Verification-System
```
```
npm install
```
Setup Ganache:

Start Ganache CLI in a separate terminal window to run a local Ethereum blockchain.
``` bash

ganache-cli
```
Deploy Smart Contracts:

Navigate to the Truffle directory and deploy the smart contracts to your local blockchain.
```bash

truffle migrate
```
Run the Web Application:

Start the Streamlit app to open the frontend application in your browser.
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Access the DApp:
Institutes can log in via MetaMask, input student details, and issue certificates.
Students can retrieve their certificates and provide them to Employers for verification.
Employers can verify certificates by entering the Certificate ID or uploading the certificate file.
Verification results will confirm if the certificate is authentic or tampered with.
### üîÑ Workflow

#### **1. Certificate Issuance Process**:

1. **Institute Login**: The institute logs in using **MetaMask** to authenticate and sign transactions.
2. **Certificate Details Input**: The institute inputs the student's details, course information, and other certificate-related metadata.
3. **Unique Certificate ID (CID)**: A **Certificate ID** is generated for each certificate. This ID is unique and ensures the certificate‚Äôs traceability.
4. **Data Hashing**: The certificate data is **hashed** using a secure hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256) to ensure data integrity.
5. **Digital Signature**: The hash is signed with the issuer‚Äôs **private key** via MetaMask, ensuring the certificate‚Äôs authenticity.
6. **Blockchain Storage**: The signed certificate hash, along with metadata, is stored on the **Ethereum blockchain**.
7. **Certificate Storage on IPFS**: The certificate PDF file is uploaded to **IPFS** (InterPlanetary File System), providing decentralized storage. The **CID** (Content Identifier) of the uploaded PDF is then stored on the blockchain.

#### **2. Certificate Verification Process**:

1. **Employer Login**: Employers log in via **MetaMask** for authentication and to ensure secure access.
2. **Input Certificate ID or Upload PDF**: Employers can either manually input the **Certificate ID** or upload the **certificate PDF** for verification.
3. **Blockchain Retrieval**: The system retrieves the certificate‚Äôs metadata, including the hash and issuer‚Äôs public key, from the blockchain.
4. **Hash Comparison**: The system recalculates the hash of the uploaded certificate and compares it with the hash stored on the blockchain.
5. **Verification Result**:
   - If the hashes **match**, the certificate is verified as **authentic**.
   - If the hashes **don‚Äôt match**, the certificate is flagged as **tampered** or **invalid**.
